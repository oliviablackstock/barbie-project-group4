          Gold is the color most typically associated with awards shows. This year's awards season, however, is being dominated by “Barbie pink.” Since its theatrical debut in July 2023, the Greta Gerwig-directed film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has reeled in over $1.3 billion in revenue, as well as worldwide acclaim. Not only did the film top the box office, it also became the highest-grossing film directed by a female director ever. “Barbie” also received critical acclaim and continues to gain various laurels. From being named American Film Institute's top 10 best films of the year to leading the 2024 Golden Globes, it's clear Barbie and her Corvette aren't slowing down.

        “Barbie” has won the inaugural Outstanding Cinematic and Box Office Achievement Award at the Golden Globes. The Warner Bros. smash, the number one box office hit of 2023 ($1.44 billion in worldwide grosses), was a natural fit to win the award. With its creative, auteurist take on an existing property, the film has been credited as helping to revitalize a Hollywood still struggling post-Covid, and it’s been welcomed as a rare non-superhero-centric blockbuster.
