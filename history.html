                <strong>Inspiration:</strong> Ruth Handler was inspired to create Barbie by watching her daughter
                play with paper dolls. She imagined a three-dimensional doll that could represent different roles
                and careers.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Barbie's physical appearance was influenced by the German doll Bild Lilli,
                which Ruth Handler encountered during a European trip. However, Barbie was redesigned to be more
                suitable for children and to represent a wholesome image.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Name and Identity:</strong> Barbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts, named after
                Ruth and Elliot Handler's daughter, Barbara. Her identity evolved, with Barbie taking on various
                professions and personas, reflecting the changing aspirations of young girls.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Career Expansion:</strong> Over the years, Barbie has pursued over 250 careers, ranging from
                astronaut to doctor to business executive. This career diversity aimed to empower girls and
                encourage them to dream big.
