          <h2>What Audiences Are Saying</h2>
          <p>"Barbie," director and co-writer Greta Gerwig’s summer splash, is a dazzling achievement, both technically and in tone. It’s a visual feast that succeeds as both a gleeful escape and a battle cry. So crammed with impeccable attention to detail is "Barbie” that you couldn’t possibly catch it all in a single sitting; you’d have to devote an entire viewing just to the accessories, for example. The costume design (led by two-time Oscar winner Jacqueline Durran) and production design (led by six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood) are constantly clever and colorful, befitting the ever-evolving icon, and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (a three-time Oscar nominee) gives everything a glossy gleam. It’s not just that Gerwig & Co. have recreated a bunch of Barbies from throughout her decades-long history, outfitted them with a variety of clothing and hairstyles, and placed them in pristine dream houses. It’s that they’ve brought these figures to life with infectious energy and a knowing wink. <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barbie-movie-review-2023">Read the full review on RogerEbert.com</a></p>

            Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the "strong" woman.

            THE GOOD ... Its bright and colourful ... Rhea Pearlman shows genuine heart ... Helen Mirren is fine as the narrator ... THE BAD ... I didn't laugh once, this is a complete wet rag as a comedy, in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places ... ... The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures ALL around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ... This had immense possibilities, but instead turned out to be a geriatric Barbie who had lost her dentures.

            I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.

            Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.
